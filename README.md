# DM4Health

## Project Overview

DM4Health is a data mining project focused on analysing health and life expectancy data using three different analytical approaches. The project demonstrates how the same dataset can be explored and analysed with different tools, including SPSS, Python, and PySpark.

The main dataset used in this project is Life Expectancy Data, which contains country-level health indicators.

## Analysis Approaches

### I2 – SPSS Analysis

This part of the project is completed using IBM SPSS.  
It focuses on traditional data mining and statistical analysis methods, such as data preprocessing, model building, and interpretation of health-related variables.  
Files related to this analysis are stored in the iteration2 folder.

### I3 – Python Analysis

This part of the project is implemented in Python and stored in the I3.py file.  
Python is used for data cleaning, exploration, and applying data mining or machine learning techniques to analyse health trends.

### I4 – PySpark Analysis

This part of the project is completed using PySpark and is provided in the I4_BDAS_Notebook.ipynb file.  
It focuses on analysing the same health dataset using a big data framework, demonstrating how data mining tasks can be handled with Spark.

## Dataset

Life Expectancy Data.csv is the main dataset used across all three approaches.  
It contains health and life expectancy indicators for multiple countries and is used to ensure consistency and comparability between SPSS, Python, and PySpark analyses.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to apply and compare three different data mining approaches on the same health dataset, identify patterns and trends, and understand the strengths of different analytical tools.
